## What is **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**?
**Big umbrella term.**

👉 **AI = machines that can act like they have intelligence.**

Examples:

* Google Maps choosing the fastest route
* Netflix recommending shows
* Face unlock on your phone

🧠 AI doesn’t mean the machine “thinks” like a human—it just follows rules or learns patterns to make decisions.
