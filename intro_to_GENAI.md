## What is **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**?
**Big umbrella term.**

👉 **AI = machines that can act like they have intelligence.**

Examples:

* Google Maps choosing the fastest route
* Netflix recommending shows
* Face unlock on your phone

🧠 AI doesn’t mean the machine “thinks” like a human—it just follows rules or learns patterns to make decisions.

## 2️⃣ What is **Machine Learning (ML)**?

**A subset of AI.**

👉 **ML = machines learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.**

Instead of saying:

> “If X happens, do Y”

You say:

> “Here’s a lot of data—figure out the pattern yourself.”

Examples:

* Email spam filters
* Product recommendations
* Credit card fraud detection

📊 The more data it sees, the better it gets.
