What are **LLMs (Large Language Models)**?

**The brain behind text-based GenAI.**

👉 **LLMs = AI models trained on massive amounts of text to understand and generate human language.**

They predict **the next best word**, again and again, very smartly.

### Examples:

* **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** – conversational, general-purpose
* **Claude (Anthropic)** – safety-focused, great at long documents
* **Gemini (Google)** – strong at reasoning, search, and multimodal tasks

🗣️ That’s why you can *talk* to them like a human.
